Accent Recognition System for Palestinian Accents
## Overview
This project delves into the development of an acoustic regional accent recognition system tailored to the Palestinian context, integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques. The system aims to identify four distinct Palestinian accents: Jerusalem, Nablus, Hebron, and Ramallah. It utilizes acoustic features extracted from speech data, including Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs), and employs AI algorithms for accent classification.
